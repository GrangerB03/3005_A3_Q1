How to run:

First, ensure that the database has been created and run the 'setup.sql' file with the query tool.
Run the first set of instructions (the create query) and then the second set (the insert query), this can
be accomplished by copying and then deleting the insert query and running the create query then pasting and
running the insert query (after deleting the create query). Next, in the Q1.py file, set the PASSWORD and DATABASE_NAME variables to the password to and name of your
database respectively. Then, run the program using the command (once in the same directory as the Q1.py file)
'python Q1.py'.
